# GameProjectSFML
We will see if there wil be any progress
Few weeks later...
So... The project is slowly developed. I am IT student, that's why commits are not very often.
Below I wrote what I am going to implement in my game. Hovever, some of these features can never appear. 
In would be no comercial project, which shows my programming skills and how clean code can i create.(educational puropuse)
List of possible features/implemented solutions(fast script): </br>
<p>
-Player is the capitan(merchant) of the cargo ship.</br>
-It will be small rpg game.</br>
-Few different ships, with different stats. </br>
-All ships will be moved by wind. All values: acceleration, momentum and so on, will by counted with ship's sails and wind vectors.</br>
-All objects : sailors, cargo, canoons etc. will pe presented as cards.</br>
-Radomly generated maps.</br>
-Player can choose his way, he can become:</br>
	--simple merchant</br>
	--pirate</br>
	--royal sailor</br>
-Many items like: canoons, cargo, sailors, gunpowder, cannon balls.
